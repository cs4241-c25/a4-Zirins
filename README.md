2. Added Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Organized file structure (/api for backend, /client for frontend)
4. Implemented GitHub OAuth authentication for easier sign-in
5. Beautified the login page
6. Used Vercel for client deployment and Render for server deployment
7. Used state management to ensure real-time updates

NOTE: It may take a few seconds for the backend to start up initially
